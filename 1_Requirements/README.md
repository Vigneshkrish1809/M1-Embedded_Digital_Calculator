# Requirements

## Introduction
* This calculator could perform simple operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division with whole numbers. But once you understand the concept you can implement even scientific functions with Arduino’s built in functions.
* The values can be sent in through a keypad (4×4 keypad) and result can be viewed on a LCD screen (16×2 Dot-matrix)
## Components Used
1.  4*4 Keypad Interface
2.  16*2 LCD Interface
3.  AVR Atmega 328 Microcontroller

## Software Used
1.  SimulIDE
2.  Visual Studio Code

## Cost and Feature
The cost was fixed and it is a one time investment

A calculator is a device that performs numerical operations. The features of this basic calculator can perform 
1.  Addition
2.  Subtraction
3.  Multiplication
4.  Division
## SWOT Analysis
### Strength
1.  It is easy to operate and user friendly.
2.  It can perform basic operations constantly.

### Weaknesses
1.  The storage capacity is very low
2.  Power supply is necessary
### Opportunities
1.  We can use a solar panel in calculators to reduce the power supply usage.
2.  We can add some additional advanced to it.
### Threats
1.  Nowadays people are not intrested in buying electronic calculator becuase calculator operations are implemented in our portable accessories like smartphones and laptops etc.

## 4W's and 1H
### Why
1.  To perform the basic numerical operations.
2.  To reduce the manpower.

### Where
1.  The calculator can be operated from anywhere.
2.  It can be used while doing maths

### Who
1.  Can be used by anyone is required to solve a numerical operation.
2.  Some provisional stores are using calculators for getting the accurate total amount. 

### When
1.  Anyone who have to solve a basic calculation.
2.  A person needs do a basic calculation in a fractions of second.

### How
1.  Giving different inputs we can find their desired output.
2.  The results of the calculators will be accurate than the manual calculations.
